# Project Overview
Paddy rice drying is a critical post-harvest process that directly affects grain quality, shelf life, and overall yield. Improper or delayed drying can lead to spoilage, mold growth, and significant losses for farmers. Accurate estimation of drying time and final yield is essential for efficient planning and quality control during storage and processing.

This application is designed to support that need by allowing users to input key environmental and crop-specific parameters, including:

Initial moisture content of the rice

Target final moisture content

Ambient temperature

Relative humidity

Using trained machine learning models, the system provides real-time predictions for:

Estimated drying time required to achieve the target moisture level

Expected yield after drying, accounting for moisture loss and handling conditions
